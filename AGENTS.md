The current GUI is as depicted in [the screenshot as captured in specs/current_form.png ](specs/current_form.png)

It should be adjusted. The changes should reflect as depicted in [the image inn specs/new_form.png ](specs/new_form.png)

These changes entail:

1) the two file selection text boxes should be significantly wider
2) the GtK switch button at "Force Video extraction" and "Autodectec by video extension" should not be filling the colomn. They should have the format as displayed in specs/new_form.png
3) The text box under the button "Start Processing" should expand to the button of the form
