Converts video / audio conversations to text and subsequently provides a summary into a managable report.

## Installation

Clone the repository. Use the dependency and package manager [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install all the dependencies of Nelumbo.

```bash
poetry install
```

## Configuration for usage with OpenAI

Create a text file _"dev.env"_ in the root of the project. This will contain the "OPENAI_API_KEY" environment variable used by the application to obtain the token associated to a valid OpenAI account when calling the API.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-A_seCR_et_key_GENERATED_foryou_by_OPENAI
```
The environment variables are loaded into the execution context of the application when run in the debugger if as such specified in the file _"launch.json"_. An example launch configuration shows how:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
